# Workflows Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains **reference workflow structures** for the frontend specification. These JSON files are:

- **Not full implementations** - They are structural references
- **Placeholder schemas** - Show node types and connections
- **Architecture examples** - Illustrate workflow patterns
- **Design references** - Help visualize the system architecture

## Files

- `amazon-sp-api-workflow.json` - Reference structure for Amazon SP-API workflow
- `walmart-api-workflow.json` - Reference structure for Walmart API workflow

## Usage

These files can be used to:
1. Understand workflow architecture
2. Plan implementation phases
3. Design frontend components that interact with workflows
4. Create visual diagrams and documentation

## Implementation Note

When ready for implementation, these structures should be:
1. Imported into n8n as starting points
2. Fully configured with actual API endpoints
3. Tested with real credentials
4. Customized for specific use cases

For now, treat these as **architectural references** for the frontend specification.
